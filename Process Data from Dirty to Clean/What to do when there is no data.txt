As with all other kinds of datasets, be on the lookout for duplicate data and ‘Null’ in open datasets. 
Null most often means that a data field was unassigned (left empty), but sometimes Null can be interpreted as 
the value, 0. It is important to understand how Null was used before you start analyzing a dataset with Null data.
